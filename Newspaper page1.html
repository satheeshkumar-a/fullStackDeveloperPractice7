                    Suspension of international flights extended till April 30, apart from approved routes

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The suspension of international flights extended till April 30, apart from the ones plying on approved routes, DGCA said on Tuesday in its revised order.


                </p>

                <p>
                    The director-general of civil aviation on Tuesday extended the suspension of international flights in India till April 30. However, this is not applicable to those flights which have already approved by the authorities. The directive comes as the ministry
                    of home affairs on Tuesday issued new directives to be implemented in the country in April, amid a surge of Covid-19 cases.


                </p>

                <p>
                    International flights were suspended in March 2020, after a nationwide lockdown was imposed in view of the Cocid-19 pandemic breakout. In May 2020, the government launched the Vande Bharat Mission to evacuate Indian stranded abroad. The mission currently
                    is in its 10th phase.
